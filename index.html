          <h2>What Does Cooking Mean?</h2>
          <p>
            Is it simply applying heat to a food product? A way of making certain food safe to eat?
            Or a way to create flavour and make food more appealing? This is just part of what Hervé This,
            the father of molecular gastronomy, has dedicated his life to finding out.
          </p>
          <p>
            We spoke to him to find out what his experiments have told him. And in the process even discovered
            the secret to cooking the perfect egg...
          </p>
          <h3 class="accent">The Perfect Egg</h3>
          <p class="highlight">
            Keep water between 67 and 68°C for a flavourful, tender yolk.

          <h3>Red</h3>
          <p>Red foods remind us of berries and soft fruits, so we anticipate a sweet taste.</p>

          <h3>Green</h3>
          <p>Fresh, zingy green colours are reminiscent of unripe fruit, promising sour or acid flavours.</p>

        <div class="card">
          <img src="images/Cards-Block.jpg" alt="White taste example" class="card-img" />
          <h3>White</h3>
          <p>White foods evoke memories of salt and salty flavours, driving the expectation of a savoury treat.</p>
